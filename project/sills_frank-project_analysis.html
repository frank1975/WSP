   <h2>Site Intent</h2>
   <p>The goals of Signs by Design are to provide quality products to their clients and to establish long term relationships by meeting all of their signage   needs.The staff at Signs by Design is looking to redesign their website to better showcase their products and give the customer a seamless, user friendly 		   browsing experience. </p>
   <p> The goal of the customer is to receive a quality custom made sign that will suite their businesses needs. The customer also needs to be assured that   Signs by Design is the right business for the job and that their products are the best available. </p>
   <p>In order for the above goals to be met we need to accomplish a redesign of this website. The current state of this site does not promote a favorable   	   user experience, look or feel. The first thing we need to do is give Signs by design an image by establishing a logo. Next we will give the outdated site   a complete overhaul so it meets todays web design needs of responsiveness, functionality and presentation. Lastly we will do a complete reorganization of   page content to give the customer a more user-friendly browsing experience that showcases the great products that Signs by Design puts out.</p>
